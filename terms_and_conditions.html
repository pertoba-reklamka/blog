<p><strong><span class="prox-b f-16 f-gry-dk lh-22">3. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION</span></strong></p>
<p>3.1 We would like an opportunity to address your concerns without a formal legal case. Before filing a claim against Company, You agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by submitting your request through our <a href="https://www.Fire Joker.com/help/other-questions">Member Services</a> page. Please be sure to select “<span class="wysiwyg-underline">Fire Joker Feedback</span>” under Topics in your request.

<p><strong><span class="prox-b f-16 f-gry-dk lh-22">4. DISPUTE RESOLUTION BY BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER</span></strong></p>
<p>4.1 You and Company agree to arbitrate any and all disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of, in connection with, or relating to this Agreement, Company’s business, any of the Programs or the Company Properties, and relationship with you, including any claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate includes any claims against Company’s employees, agents or any subsidiaries of Company. Arbitration is a method of claim resolution that is less formal than a traditional court proceeding in state or federal court. It uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury and the arbitrator’s decision is subject to limited review by courts.</p>
<p>4.2 All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the scope, interpretation, breach, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of this Agreement) shall be decided by the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. You further agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate.</p>
<p>4.3 <strong><span class="prox-b f-16 f-gry-dk lh-22">CLASS ACTION WAIVER: YOU AND COMPANY ALSO AGREE THAT EACH IS GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL AND THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITIES, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION</span></strong>. This means that neither you nor Company can seek to assert class or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and the Company further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph, known as the “Class Action Waiver,” are found to be unenforceable, it cannot be severed from this arbitration agreement and the entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void.</p>
<p>4.4 To the extent possible under your local law, the arbitration shall be administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those rules or pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (“Rules”). The Rules are available online at www.jamsadr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in arbitration is for less than $10,000, Company will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. The exclusive venue for any dispute or issue arising out of this Agreement shall be held in San Francisco County, California.</p>
<p>4.5 Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that if we make any future, material change to this arbitration provision, you may reject any change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. DBA Fire Joker Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal. Your decision to reject changes in a new arbitration provision, however, does not affect any prior arbitration provisions to which you have already agreed, which would still remain in effect.</p>
<p>4.6 This arbitration provision is optional. You may decline or opt out of this agreement to arbitrate by sending written and signed notice to Ebates Performance Marketing, Inc. dba Fire Joker Rewards, 800 Concar Drive, Suite 175, San Mateo, CA 94402, Attn: Legal within thirty (30) calendar days of enrolling as a Member or using Company Properties.</p>
<p>4.7 Judgment upon the arbitration award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction, or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p>
<p><strong><span class="prox-b f-16 f-gry-dk lh-22">5. PROGRAM LICENSE</span></strong></p>
<p>5.1 Subject to this Agreement, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license (without the right to sublicense) to access and use the Company Properties for your personal use to access the Program(s).

Company pays its Members accrued Cash Back and Cash Back Program related rewards in accordance with the current <a href="https://www.ebates.com/help/article/getting-your-ebates-cash-back-payments-115009255748">payment schedule</a>. Please note that accrual rates vary depending on the Affiliate Store’s policies and reporting schedules. For example, Cash Back for travel-related purchases typically does not accrue until after travel has been completed. Company reserves the right to delay payment for any purchase based on changes to Affiliate Store policies at any time. Company also reserves the right to modify the payment schedule at any time. Company is not responsible for payments delivered to the wrong address through no fault of Company or for payment errors made by payment partners, like PayPal.

Any such adjustments will be made in accordance with this Agreement, any applicable Company policies and terms, the terms of the Affiliate Store offer and any and all applicable laws, rules and regulations. The determination of whether a purchase made through an Affiliate Store qualifies for Cash Back is at the sole discretion of Company. If an Affiliate Store fails to report a transaction to Company or fails to make payment to Company for any reason, Company reserves the right to cancel the Cash Back associated with that transaction. It is your responsibility to check your Account regularly to ensure that Cash Back has been properly credited and paid and that your Account balance is accurate. If you believe that Cash Back has not been correctly credited to your account, you must contact Company Member Services within ninety (90) days of the transaction. In addition, Company may make account adjustments for any Cash Back that Company, in its sole discretion, deems as fraudulent, abusive, unethical, suspicious or otherwise inconsistent with the Referral Program Terms, this Agreement or any other applicable law or regulation.

If your account remains inactive for more than twelve (12) consecutive months and the balance in your inactive account is or becomes zero, Company reserves the right to close the Account permanently and cease to maintain your Account records and Program access. Maintenance Fees are nonrefundable, but will not cause your account balance to become negative, and will not cause you to owe money to Company.</p>
<p>12.3 <strong><span class="prox-b f-16 f-gry-dk lh-22">Fraudulent Activity. </span></strong>We reserve the right to investigate any purchase transactions, referral activity, or interaction with any Company Property that we believe, in our sole discretion, is abusing or has abused the Program. We reserve the right to rescind any Cash Back, bar further Cash Back awards and/or bonuses, and/or terminate any Member Account that we believe, in our sole discretion, is abusing or has abused the Program, including, without limitation, by engaging in a pattern of returning products after the corresponding Cash Back has been credited or making fraudulent referrals by creating multiple Accounts. Multiple Accounts created under the Refer-A-Friend Program with the same name, address, email address or other identifying feature may be flagged as fraudulent referrals. Any failure to comply with this Agreement, any fraud or abuse relating to the accrual or receipt of Cash Back or other rewards and bonuses, or any misrepresentation of any information furnished to Company by you or anyone acting on your behalf may result in the termination of your Account and forfeiture of any accrued Cash Back rewards.
